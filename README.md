<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Phone numbers are very long and difficult to remember. Some people have very long email with unpronounceable nickname. AirCard will help you to share your number and email with other people without the hassle of spelling or writing your number.
Create your AirCard, choose your wallpaper, and a transparent QR code of your contact info will be added. Download it to your smartphone, and set it as a wallpaper. The next time you meet someone new, hand over your smartphone to them, and let them scan the code with their smartphone camera app (natively supported by all recent devices, no need of a third party app). Tada ! Now your friend will have your number and email without getting into a spelling nightmare !
